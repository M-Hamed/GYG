Disappointed that the main hall was closed to the tour, as an event was being organised. The tour I was in, was very large and unfortunately at times, it was difficult to hear the guide. I would recommend the tour.","author":"a GetYourGuide Customer \u2013 Girvan, United Kingdom","foreignLanguage":false,"date":"June 24, 2014","date_unformatted":{},"languageCode":"en","traveler_type":"solo","reviewerName":"Audrey","reviewerCountry":"Girvan, United Kingdom"}
